# Real Time Bus Tracker

This is a JavaScript program to display real-time bus information for buses of the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) on Route 1.

# Installation

Requires the index.html, real-time_bus_tracker.js, and styles.css files to be in the same directory.

# Usage

Load the HTML file in a browser to see the markers on the map.  An update of the data is requested every 15 seconds, though processing time may cause the updates to take longer.
Note that the operational hours for this route are not 24/7, so it is possible that there may be no bus data to display if there are no buses running at the time.

# Support

No support is provided for this application.  Use at your own discretion.

# Roadmap

Plans to update the markers with better images, possibly adding additional information.

# License information

No licensing is required by the author for use of this project.
